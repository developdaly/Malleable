<h1>A guide to Malleable</h1>

<p><em>Malleable</em> is a child theme for the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme">Hybrid theme framework</a>, which means you must have <em>Hybrid</em> installed to use <em>Malleable</em>.  Don't worry.  Just because it uses a framework doesn't mean it's complicated.  It just means that your site will be a lot more powerful and all you have to do is have <em>Hybrid</em> installed.</p>

<p>Nothing more.  Nothing less.</p>

<h2>Front Page Template</h2>

<p>The theme comes packaged with an extra <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Page_Templates" title="WordPress Page Templates">page template</a> for you to use called <em>Front Page</em>.</p>

<p>When you write a page, scroll down toward the bottom of the <em>Write Page</em> panel and select the template of your choosing.  You can also set this as your home page by going to <em>Settings > Reading</em> and choosing the page you added the template to as your front page.</p>

<p>You'll also want to add feature images and thumbnails to your posts to make them look good.  For your convenience both of these are located under the <em>Hybrid Settings</em> meta box when you write a post.  Of course, <em>Hybrid</em> has a built-in image script that will automatically include images for you (if you've attached an image).</p>

<p>The settings for this page template are located at <em>Appearance > Malleable</em>.</p>

<h2>Theme Support &amp; Community</h2>

<p>The most authoritative sources for finding out how to use the theme or do some nifty stuff are the <a href="http://developdaly.com/themes/mallebale/" title="Malleable WordPress theme">Malleable</a> and <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme">Hybrid</a> theme tutorials.</p>

<p>I also have <a href="http://forums.developdaly.com/forum/malleable">support forums</a> for all of my themes.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a vibrant community at the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/support" title="Theme Hybrid support forums">Theme Hybrid Support Forums</a>.  If you ever lose the link, you can find it right from your Hybrid Settings page in your WordPress dashboard.</p>
